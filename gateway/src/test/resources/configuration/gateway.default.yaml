# Zeebe standalone gateway configuration file.
# For the configuration of the embedded gateway see the gateway section of the zeebe.cfg.yaml

# In order to activate the settings in this file, please set the following environment variable:
# export spring.config.additional-location='file:./config/gateway.cfg.yaml'

# Overview -------------------------------------------

# This file contains a complete list of available configuration options.

# Default values:
#
# When the default value is used for a configuration option, the option is
# commented out. You can learn the default value from this file

# Conventions:
#
# Byte sizes
# For buffers and others must be specified as strings and follow the following
# format: "10U" where U (unit) must be replaced with KB = Kilobytes, MB = Megabytes or GB = Gigabytes.
# If unit is omitted then the default unit is simply bytes.
# Example:
# sendBufferSize = "16MB" (creates a buffer of 16 Megabytes)
#
# Time units
# Timeouts, intervals, and the likes, must be specified either in the standard ISO-8601 format used
# by java.time.Duration, or as strings with the following format: "VU", where:
#   - V is a numerical value (e.g. 1, 5, 10, etc.)
#   - U is the unit, one of: ms = Millis, s = Seconds, m = Minutes, or h = Hours
#
# Paths:
# Relative paths are resolved relative to the installation directory of the gateway.
